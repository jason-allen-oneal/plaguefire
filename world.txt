# Balen: The Complete World Guide

## The World

Balen is the name of both the world and its creator god. The world is characterized by diverse regions and the aftermath of a catastrophic magical event known as the Rupture.

## The Rupture (35 Years Ago)

**Cause:** Wizards hoarded and drained ley lines of raw magic until they collapsed.

**Event:** A spark ignited pockets of raw magic in Greenflame, mutating creatures, twisting landscapes, and shattering the world.

**Effects:**
- Stones turned to glass, wood petrified
- Humans and animals mutated; some gained dangerous abilities
- Refugees poured into Stormreach, swelling the Outmarsh

**Legacy:** Magic users are distrusted and reviled. Greenflame relics fetch fortunes on the black market.

## The Rupture's Aftermath in Travia

### Timeline Overview

The Rupture occurred 35 years ago, fundamentally reshaping the political, economic, and social landscape of Travia. This document tracks the recovery and current state of the region.

### Immediate Effects (0–10 years after the Rupture)

#### Trade Collapse
- Caravans from Realth stopped moving due to marauders, warped creatures, and shattered leyline routes
- River traffic dried up — magic-built bridges and waystones exploded or turned to glass
- Stormreach, already damaged, became a half-ruined refugee hub

#### Refugee Floods
- Survivors from burned towns poured into Stormreach and other cities, overwhelming resources
- Outmarsh formed during this period, a sprawl of desperation

#### Magic Panic
- Mages were lynched or driven out
- Reliance on magical infrastructure meant entire economies buckled
- Crops failed where irrigation wards collapsed; roads crumbled without arcane reinforcement

### Recovery Period (10–25 years after the Rupture)

- **Stormreach:** Rebuilt faster than most, thanks to its delta position — even damaged, it was a natural trade nexus
- **Dalehaven:** Farms stabilized food supply, though plagued by mutated pests and failing soils
- **Olthrya:** Seized the chance to rise, pushing guild-driven trade to bypass Stormreach's chaos
- **Riven:** Fortified, leaning on dwarves for survival. The dwarves became gatekeepers to mountain routes and ores

### Present Day (~35 years after the Rupture)

- **Stormreach:** Restored as the de facto trade hub, but corruption festers. Its recovery made it richer than ever, but its Outmarsh scars remain
- **Delinor:** Wealth returning, but society is brittle. The Iron Guard hold order by force
- **Dalehaven:** Recovering farmlands feed the region again, though yields are weaker. Their leaders fear exploitation by Stormreach merchants
- **Olthrya:** Stronger than before the Rupture, but resentful of Delinor's resurgence. They see themselves as the true heirs of river trade
- **Riven:** More insular, propped up by dwarves. Its king owes as much allegiance to the Throne of the Gods as to his own people
- **Realth:** Caravans move again, but routes remain dangerous. Stormreach profits heavily as the funnel for exotic goods
- **Ha'alazi:** Trade rare but resumed. Rumors say the Rupture woke something across the sea — sailors return with stranger relics than ever

### Present Balance

- **Tenuous Stability:** Trade flows again, but it's fragile — banditry, mutant beasts, and corruption threaten every link
- **Fractured Trust:** Every kingdom blames the others for failures during the Rupture. Old alliances are shaky, rivalries sharp
- **Opportunity in Chaos:** Merchants, thieves, nobles, and cultists all profit from uncertainty
- **The Greenflame Legacy:** Outmarsh cults whisper that the Rupture was no accident but the birth of a new god (Vaelith)

## Kingdoms and Empires of the Known World

### The Four Kingdoms of Travia

Travia is the broader land in which Stormreach and its neighbors sit — a patchwork of kingdoms, city-states, and trade hubs that both cooperate and feud.

#### Delinor
**Capital & Jewel:** Stormreach, the great delta trade city.

**Identity:** Maritime wealth, coin-driven politics, corrupted nobility.

**Government:** Ruled by the Patrician of Stormreach, whose authority is absolute and enforced by the Iron Guard.

**Culture:** Greed and trade are its lifeblood. Nobles cling to power through merchant monopolies, while commoners in Riverside and Outmarsh struggle to survive.

**After the Rupture:** Stormreach was damaged but not destroyed. Refugees swelled its size, creating the Outmarsh. Its recovery has made it richer than ever, but bitterly divided.

**Reputation:** Feared and admired — "the city where fortune is bought in blood."

**Relations:**
- Rivals with Olthrya (competes in trade)
- Strong but strained ties to Dalehaven (needs inland grain)
- Wary of Riven (dwarves can choke mountain trade if provoked)

#### Dalehaven
**Capital:** Greenhaven, seat of its agrarian lords.

**Identity:** The breadbasket of Travia. Fertile farmlands, river valleys, and steady harvests.

**Government:** A Council of Lords, cooperative compared to Delinor's cutthroat nobility.

**Culture:** Rural, pragmatic, family-oriented. Reveres Veyra, goddess of growth.

**After the Rupture:** Crop failures devastated the land, but Dalehaven recovered to become the region's lifeline again.

**Reputation:** Respected for stability, but often dismissed as provincial by Delinor's elites.

**Relations:**
- Supplies Stormreach with grain in exchange for access to exotic goods
- Distrustful of Riven's dwarves, who tax or raid shipments
- Tries to remain neutral in conflicts between Delinor and Olthrya

#### Olthrya
**Identity:** A proud independent city-state and Stormreach's trade rival.

**Government:** Ruled by the Merchant-King (or Queen), chosen by guilds every decade.

**Culture:** Mercantile, guild-driven, fiercely independent. Known for fine textiles and organized trade networks.

**After the Rupture:** Capitalized on Delinor's weakness, nearly surpassing Stormreach in influence before Delinor's resurgence.

**Reputation:** Cunning, ambitious, and pragmatic — always looking for a way to cut Delinor out of the trade routes.

**Relations:**
- Fierce trade rival of Stormreach
- Competes for control of river access into Dalehaven
- Maintains delicate trade relations with Ha'alazi merchants who cross the western sea

#### Riven
**Capital:** Overbridge, a fortress straddling the northern river.

**Identity:** Small but fiercely independent, propped up by dwarven allies from the Throne of the Gods.

**Government:** A monarch, but dwarves wield significant influence.

**Culture:** Militaristic and communal, with deep ties to dwarven stonecraft and metallurgy.

**After the Rupture:** Survived through dwarven support, but increasingly dependent on them.

**Reputation:** Respected for discipline and fortifications, but seen as a pawn of the dwarves.

**Relations:**
- Proud history of resisting Delinor's attempts to control trade routes
- Dwarves view Riven as their gateway to the lowlands — but also as a pawn
- Longstanding grudges with Dalehaven farmers over territorial borders

### Neighboring Nations and Empires

#### Realth — The Desert Kingdoms
**Location:** South of Travia, across vast deserts and steppes.

**Identity:** Merchant-caravan lords, spice empires, oasis cities.

**Government:** Loosely allied emirates beneath the ceremonial Throne of Glass.

**Culture:** Known for silks, rare dyes, incense, and monumental libraries. Wealth flows from caravans and exotic trade.

**After the Rupture:** Caravans collapsed, routes lost to Greenflame-blighted deserts. Trade only recently resumed, enriching Stormreach again.

**Currency:** Portif — oval bronze/silver coins, often pierced for jewelry.

**Reputation:** Exotic and wealthy, but fragmented — both rival and partner to Travia.

#### Ha'alazi — The Distant West
**Location:** Across the western sea from Travia.

**Identity:** Shrouded in mystery; feared and desired in equal measure.

**Government:** Rumored Triad of Monarchs — Sun, Sea, and Shadow — ruling in shifting alliances.

**Culture:** Artifacts unlike anything in Travia: bone-carved idols, dream-glass, living-metal tools. Religion and craft seem inseparable.

**After the Rupture:** Trade ceased for decades. Relics that now emerge are stranger than before, fueling fears the Rupture awakened something in Ha'alazi.

**Reputation:** A land of treasures and curses. Travian merchants both covet and dread their wares.

#### The Veyrian Empire — Broken Colossus
**Location:** East of Travia, beyond plains and the great lake.

**Identity:** Once the greatest empire, now a decaying relic.

**Government:** A fractured Imperial Court, paralyzed by generals, priests, and nobles vying for power.

**Culture:** Obsessed with past glory — aqueducts, palaces, and roads stand as monuments to a fading era.

**After the Rupture:** Provinces seceded, legions collapsed, and vassals broke free. Yet Veyria lingers, its shadow still vast.

**Reputation:** To Travia, both opportunity and threat — a sleeping giant that could collapse or rise again.

#### The Thalyrian Concord — Scholar-States
**Location:** Northeast of Travia, along the great lake bordering Veyria.

**Identity:** Independent city-states bound by shared devotion to law and knowledge.

**Government:** Councils of scholars, judges, and philosophers.

**Culture:** Obsessed with preserving and debating knowledge. Archives and academies define their power.

**After the Rupture:** Preserved much lore others lost, making them envied but distrusted. Whispers claim they guard forbidden research.

**Reputation:** Brilliant but arrogant; outsiders joke they would debate while the world burned.

#### The Sylari Dominion — The Veil of Masks
**Location:** Southeast, past Realth's deserts, in lush coasts and riverlands.

**Identity:** A nation where faith and theater are inseparable.

**Government:** The Masked Court, nobles and priests who wear sacred masks representing divine archetypes.

**Religion:** Worship through The Thousand Faces, divine aspects expressed through masks and roles. Each ritual mask embodies a god's fragment — the Judge, the Trickster, the Mother, the Warrior. Politics, theater, and worship are the same act, binding ruler and priest into one.

**Culture:** Festivals, sacred dramas, and processions dominate life. To foreigners, this is awe-inspiring but unnerving.

**After the Rupture:** Declared the collapse proof of others' folly. Claimed their masks shielded them from corruption. Outsiders suspect darker truths.

**Reputation:** Beautiful, strange, untrustworthy — a society where no one ever knows the face behind the mask.

## Stormreach: City of Trade and Ruin

### Identity & Origins

**Founded by:** Neryan Vost, hundreds of years ago, as a strategic trade outpost.

**Location:** Built on the delta of the River Untrel at the edge of the sea.

**Purpose:** Stormreach grew as the primary crossroads between inland kingdoms, desert lands, mountain strongholds, and distant western shores. The River Untrel serves as the main trade artery connecting the Four Kingdoms.

**Reputation:** Known far and wide as a wealthy trade hub, but also a dangerous den of corruption. "Fortune is bought in blood" is a common saying about the city.

### Districts

## Races of Travia

### Civilized Peoples

#### Humans
**Where:** Dominant in Delinor (Stormreach), Dalehaven (Greenhaven), Olthrya, and Riven.

**Identity:** Pragmatic, ambitious, divided by class.

**After the Rupture:**
- Humans suffered the worst: their wizard-kings drained ley lines, causing the collapse
- Refugee waves reshaped cities like Stormreach
- Humans dominate politics, but they are fragmented — nobles vs. merchants vs. commoners

**Reputation:** Blamed for hubris, but also credited for rebuilding fastest.

#### Dwarves
**Where:** Halls of the Throne of the Gods and strong presence in Riven.

**Identity:** Industrious, proud, tied to stone and metal.

**After the Rupture:**
- Dwarves weathered the disaster better than most, since their societies relied on craftsmanship, not ley lines
- They now control ore and metallurgy, giving them political leverage over Riven and beyond

**Reputation:** Reliable but stubborn. Some say they exploit the chaos to tighten their grip on trade.

#### Elves
**Where:** Forest enclaves, scattered sanctuaries, and some refugee communities in cities.

**Identity:** Mystical, enduring, deeply tied to nature.

**Magic:** Unaffected by the Rupture — elven magic flows from nature, not ley lines or divine blessing.

**After the Rupture:**
- Resented by humans for surviving with their magic intact
- Sought out for healing and restoration, but distrusted for refusing to "share" their secrets
- Younger elves debate whether to remain isolated or become more active in world affairs

**Reputation:** Enigmatic survivors, viewed with a mix of jealousy and suspicion.

#### Halflings
**Where:** Primarily Dalehaven's farmlands and river valleys.

**Identity:** Humble farmers, sharp traders, cheerful riverfolk.

**After the Rupture:**
- While not magically powerful, halflings became crucial for food stability
- Many families turned to river-barge trade, connecting rural goods to Stormreach

**Reputation:** Dependable, underestimated, but now wield quiet influence through food and trade.

#### Gnomes
**Where:** Olthrya's guilds, hidden tinkers' quarters in Stormreach, scattered enclaves.

**Identity:** Inventive, eccentric, clever craftsmen.

**After the Rupture:**
- Lost much of their magical artistry when ley lines collapsed
- Turned toward mechanical inventions and alchemy, sometimes dangerously unstable
- Rumors say gnomes were the first to weaponize Greenflame relics

**Reputation:** Brilliant but reckless, tolerated when useful, distrusted when experiments go wrong.

### Shadowed & Savage Peoples

#### Orcs
**Where:** Borderlands between Dalehaven and Riven, scattered warbands across the wilds.

**Identity:** Fierce, tribal, proud.

**After the Rupture:**
- Many orc clans were twisted by Greenflame, becoming stronger but unstable
- Some serve as mercenaries for coin or honor

**Reputation:** Feared raiders, but also respected warriors when disciplined.

#### Goblins
**Where:** Swamps, caves, and slums like the Outmarsh in Stormreach.

**Identity:** Resourceful scavengers, sly and cruel.

**After the Rupture:**
- Goblins adapted quickly, thriving in chaos
- Many live as smugglers or thieves within Stormreach's underbelly

**Reputation:** Vermin to nobles, useful scum to criminals, dangerous in numbers.

#### Trolls
**Where:** Marshes, deep forests, riverside ruins.

**Identity:** Brutish, predatory, feared.

**After the Rupture:**
- Some trolls mutated with regenerative Greenflame corruption, nearly unkillable
- Stormreach sailors tell tales of trolls dragging barges into rivers

**Reputation:** Monsters — few see them as anything else.

#### Giants
**Where:** Remote highlands and the far reaches of the Throne of the Gods.

**Identity:** Ancient, elemental, tied to primal forces.

**After the Rupture:**
- Many went mad; some enslaved orcs and goblins as thralls
- At least one giant is rumored to guard a still-burning ley line fracture in the mountains

**Reputation:** Terrifying relics of an older world, both respected and feared.

### Cross-Racial Notes

#### Greenflame Mutants
Any race can be mutated by the Rupture's Greenflame. Mutants are despised, feared, or exploited, often pushed into Outmarsh ghettos or wilderness exile.

#### Half-Breeds
Half-elves, half-orcs, and other crossbreeds exist, but prejudice is harsher since the Rupture worsened suspicion of the "other."

#### Religious Split
- **Humans, dwarves, and halflings** lean heavily on the Thirteen of Balen
- **Elves** respect the pantheon but place nature above it
- **Goblins, trolls, and orcs** often twist the pantheon into tribal cults or serve darker spirits

## World Regions

- **Realth:** Exotic deserts, source of rare goods and spices
- **Greenhaven & Olthrya:** Inland heartlands linked by Stormreach's river trade
- **Throne of the Gods:** Towering northern mountains, said to be the seat of Balen
- **Ha'alazi:** Mysterious western land, rarely visited, its relics priceless and dangerous

## Political Tensions & Trade Web

- **Stormreach** thrives as the middleman of the region, but everyone resents its stranglehold
- **Dalehaven** relies on Stormreach to move its goods, but fears exploitation
- **Olthrya** seeks to cut Stormreach out of trade by building alternate routes
- **Riven**, with dwarven backing, controls key northern passes and river crossings — a bottleneck that Stormreach both needs and hates
- **Realth** feeds the wealth of all, but its caravans are often taxed or raided before reaching Stormreach
- **Ha'alazi** remains more rumor than ally — but whoever controls that trade would gain unimaginable power

## Pantheon of Balen

Twelve gods, tied to daily life, the Rupture, and the Throne of the Gods mountains.

### Major Deities
- **Balen, the World-Father** — endurance, creator
- **Ilyra, Lady of the Stars** — prophecy, fate

### Lesser Deities
- **Thalos, God of the Sea** — oceans, storms
- **Veyra, Goddess of Growth** — crops, fertility
- **Korvall, Smith of Flame** — forge, craft
- **Edrath, Judge of Law** — justice, oaths
- **Selmira, Lady of Mercy** — healing, redemption
- **Calros, Trickster of Fortune** — chance, gamblers
- **Nysera, Mistress of Shadows** — secrets, assassins
- **Droskan, Lord of Death** — endings, afterlife
- **Atheron, Lord of War** — conquest, victory
- **Meris, Lady of Trade** — wealth, contracts

## Key Story Implications

- **Economic Tension:** Stormreach's dominance creates resentment and opportunity for disruption
- **Social Fractures:** The Outmarsh represents the permanent scars of the Rupture
- **Political Instability:** Alliances are fragile, creating opportunities for manipulation
- **Magical Distrust:** The fear of magic and its consequences shapes society
- **Class Tensions:** Human society is deeply divided, creating opportunities for conflict and alliance
- **Economic Power:** Dwarves control essential resources, giving them political leverage
- **Social Outcasts:** Mutants and half-breeds face increased prejudice
- **Religious Complexity:** Different races have different relationships with the pantheon

## World Foundations for Travia

### Currency

#### Quadbit
**Standard coinage** of the Four Kingdoms (Delinor, Dalehaven, Olthrya, Riven).

**Origin:** Minted after the founding of Travia, stamped with four faces or symbols for each kingdom.

**Denominations:**
- Whole Quadbit (gold)
- Half-bit (silver)
- Quarter-bit (copper)
- Larger trade often done in weighed bars

#### Portif
**Currency of Realth.**

Sleek coins of pressed bronze or silver, often square or oval. Merchants in Stormreach accept them at fluctuating rates.

**Future Expansion:** Ha'alazi's mysterious coinage or dwarven rune-bars that hold cultural value beyond weight.

### Calendar

#### Ages
**Long epochs** of 2000 years.

**Current Age:** Second Age.

**The Rupture:** Occurred in the year 352 of the Second Age.

#### Question of Timekeeping

**Option A (Keep Old Calendar):** The world continues to count years normally (e.g., 2A 387 today). This reflects a desire to cling to continuity, especially among nobles and scholars.

**Option B (Shift to AR):** Common folk and refugees mark time as "After the Rupture" (e.g., 35 AR). This would highlight how deeply the catastrophe scarred culture.

**Compromise:** Nobles and academics insist on the "proper" 2A calendar, but commoners increasingly use AR. This dual system provides a subtle class contrast in dialogue.

### Magic & Law

#### Anti-Mage Laws
Magic is **legal in theory, but heavily distrusted.**

**Noble Regulation:** Nobles in Delinor regulate artifacts, not mages themselves.

**Underground Magic:** Cults and hedge-mages survive in the cracks.

**Narrative Tension:** Nobles secretly hoard magical relics while publicly blaming magic for the Rupture — a clear hypocrisy that creates story opportunities.

### Technology

#### Black Powder
**Not present.**

This keeps the world firmly in a **high-fantasy / late-medieval aesthetic.**

Innovation after the Rupture is driven by **craft, trade, and desperation**, not firearms.

#### Craft Innovation

**Dwarves:** Lean into hydraulics, stonecraft, and metallurgy.

**Gnomes:** Experiment with alchemy and mechanical contraptions (dangerous, unreliable).

**Elves:** Remain steady in their nature-based artistry.

**Innovation Drivers:** Craft, trade, and desperation rather than technological advancement.

# Extreme Refactors Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of major architectural features added to Plaguefire.

## Overview

Four significant systems were implemented, each requiring substantial architectural changes:

1. **Item Instance Tracking System** - Individual item tracking with charges and inscriptions
2. **Mining System** - Digging mechanics with mineral veins and treasure
3. **Chest Interaction System** - Locks, traps, disarming, and contents generation

## 1. Item Instance Tracking System

### Purpose
Enable tracking of individual item instances rather than just item names, allowing for unique properties per item.

### Key Features

#### ItemInstance Class
- **Charge Tracking**: Wands and staves now track current and maximum charges
- **Identification System**: Items can be identified, tried, or unknown
- **Inscriptions**: 
  - `{empty}` for depleted wands/staves
  - `{tried}` for unidentified used items
  - `{magik}` for magical items detected by high-level characters (level 5+)
  - `{damned}` for cursed items
  - Custom player inscriptions
- **Instance Properties**: Each item has unique instance ID, charges, identification status

#### InventoryManager Class
- Manages collections of ItemInstance objects
- Provides backward compatibility with string-based item names
- Supports equipment and inventory management
- Serialization for save/load

### Implementation Details

**Files Created:**
- `app/lib/core/item_instance.py` - Core ItemInstance class with charge and inscription system
- `app/lib/core/inventory_manager.py` - Inventory management with instances
- `tests/test_item_instances.py` - Comprehensive test suite (6 tests, all passing)

**Key Methods:**
```python
# Creating instances
ItemInstance.from_template(item_id, item_data)

# Using charges
instance.use_charge()  # Returns True if charge available
instance.is_empty()    # Check if wand/staff is depleted

# Inscriptions
instance.get_inscription()            # Get inscription text
instance.get_display_name(level)      # Full name with {inscriptions}
instance.mark_tried()                 # Mark as tried but not identified
instance.identify()                    # Identify the item
```

**Data Changes:**
- Item charges are randomly generated based on template's `charges` field
- Example: Staff with `"charges": [10, 20]` gets 10-20 charges on creation

### Usage Example
```python
from app.lib.core.item_instance import ItemInstance
from app.lib.core.data_loader import GameData

data_loader = GameData()
staff_data = data_loader.get_item("STAFF_CURE_LIGHT_WOUNDS")
staff = ItemInstance.from_template("STAFF_CURE_LIGHT_WOUNDS", staff_data)

# Staff starts with random charges (e.g., 15/15)
staff.use_charge()  # Now 14/15
staff.use_charge()  # Now 13/15

# Display name shows inscriptions
print(staff.get_display_name(5))  # "Staff of Cure Light Wounds {magik}"

# Use all charges
while staff.use_charge():
    pass

# Now shows empty
print(staff.get_display_name(5))  # "Staff of Cure Light Wounds {empty, magik}"
```

### Backward Compatibility
The system is designed to be backward compatible:
- `InventoryManager.get_legacy_inventory()` returns list of item names
- Existing code can continue using string-based item references
- Future integration will migrate Player class to use instances

---

## 2. Mining System

### Purpose
Implement Moria-style mining mechanics with mineral veins, digging tools, and treasure spawning.

### Key Features

#### Tile Types
- **Quartz Vein** (`%`): Richest veins, easier to dig, high gem/metal yield
- **Magma Vein** (`~`): Medium difficulty, moderate treasure
- **Granite** (`#`): Hardest to dig, same appearance as walls

#### Digging Mechanics
- **Progress Tracking**: Digging takes multiple turns based on tool and material
- **Tool Bonuses**: 
  - Pick: +2
  - Dwarven Pick: +4 (best)
  - Orcish Pick: +3
  - Shovel: +1
  - Dwarven Shovel: +3
  - Gnomish Shovel: +2
- **Material Hardness**:
  - Quartz Vein: 3 (easiest)
  - Magma Vein: 5 (medium)
  - Granite/Wall: 8 (hardest)

#### Treasure Spawning
**Quartz Veins:**
- 60% chance of gems (Diamond, Ruby, Emerald, Sapphire, Opal, Pearl)
- 40% chance of metals (Copper, Silver, Gold, Platinum coins)
- 2-5 items per vein

**Magma Veins:**
- 30% chance of gems
- 30% chance of metals
- 20% chance of random items (potions, scrolls, armor)
- 1-3 items per vein

### Implementation Details

**Files Created:**
- `app/lib/core/mining_system.py` - Core mining mechanics and treasure generation
- `app/lib/generation/maps/generate.py` - Added vein placement functions
- `tests/test_mining.py` - Complete test suite (8 tests, all passing)

**Files Modified:**
- `config.py` - Added vein tile constants
- `data/items.json` - Added `digging_bonus` property to all picks and shovels

**Key Methods:**
```python
# Mining system
mining = MiningSystem()
success, msg, treasure = mining.dig(x, y, tile, weapon_name)

# Vein detection (for spells/abilities)
veins = mining.detect_veins(game_map, center_x, center_y, radius=10)

# Check if tool can dig
is_tool = mining.is_digging_tool(weapon_name)
```

**Map Generation:**
```python
from app.lib.generation.maps.generate import add_mineral_veins

# Add veins to generated dungeon
dungeon = generate_room_corridor_dungeon(width, height)
dungeon = add_mineral_veins(dungeon, depth)
```

### Usage Example
```python
from app.lib.core.mining_system import get_mining_system

mining = get_mining_system()

# Player wielding Dwarven Pick digs at quartz vein
x, y = 10, 10
tile = game_map[y][x]  # QUARTZ_VEIN

success, msg, treasure = mining.dig(x, y, tile, "Dwarven Pick")
# Dwarven Pick: bonus=4, quartz hardness=3
# Progress per turn = max(1, 4 - 3//2) = 3
# Completes in 1 turn!

if success and treasure:
    print(f"Found: {treasure}")
    # Example: ['GEM_DIAMOND', 'GEM_RUBY', 'COIN_GOLD', 'COIN_PLATINUM']
```

### Vein Distribution
- Vein count scales with depth and map size
- Base veins = max(3, depth // 2)
- Quartz: 0.8-1.2× base veins
- Magma: 1.0-1.5× base veins
- Veins grow in organic clusters using random walk algorithm

## 3. Chest Interaction System

### Purpose
Implement comprehensive chest mechanics with locks, traps, multiple interaction methods, and depth-scaled treasure.

### Key Features

#### Chest Properties
- **Locks**: Difficulty scales with chest type (Wooden < Iron < Steel) and depth
- **Traps**: 7 trap types with varying effects
- **Contents**: Depth-scaled treasure generation
- **States**: Locked/unlocked, trapped/safe, opened/closed, intact/destroyed

#### Interaction Methods
1. **Lockpicking** (Open command)
   - Skill-based success chance
   - Non-destructive
   - Can trigger traps

2. **Trap Disarming**
   - Requires disarming skill
   - Must be done before opening to avoid trap
   - Can fail and trigger trap

3. **Force Opening**
   - Strength-based success chance
   - 70% chance to trigger trap
   - 30% chance to destroy contents
   - Useful when lacking lockpicking skill

#### Trap Types
- **Poison Needle**: Direct damage + poison effect
- **Poison Gas**: Area poison effect
- **Summon Monster**: Spawns enemy
- **Alarm**: Wakes nearby monsters
- **Explosion**: Fire damage
- **Dart**: Physical damage
- **Magic Drain**: Drains mana

#### Contents Generation
**Distribution by roll:**
- 30% Coins (Copper/Silver/Gold/Platinum)
- 20% Potions (depth-appropriate)
- 15% Scrolls (depth-appropriate)
- 10% Weapons (depth-appropriate)
- 10% Armor (depth-appropriate)
- 10% Wands/Staves (depth-appropriate)
- 5% Gems (Diamond/Ruby/Emerald/Sapphire/Opal/Pearl)

**Quantity by chest size:**
- Small: 2-4 items
- Large: 4-8 items
- Destroyed: 0-2 items (30% chance when forced)

### Implementation Details

**Files Created:**
- `app/lib/core/chest_system.py` - ChestInstance and ChestSystem classes
- `tests/test_chests.py` - Full test suite (9 tests, all passing)

**Key Classes:**
```python
class ChestInstance:
    # Create chest at position with depth-scaled properties
    chest = ChestInstance(chest_id, name, x, y, depth)
    
    # Interaction methods
    success, msg = chest.disarm_trap(player_skill)
    success, msg, trap = chest.open_chest(player_skill)
    success, msg, trap = chest.force_open(player_strength)
    
    # Contents
    items = chest.generate_contents()

class ChestSystem:
    # Manage all chests on current level
    system = ChestSystem()
    system.add_chest(chest)
    chest = system.get_chest(x, y)
```

### Usage Example
```python
from app.lib.core.chest_system import ChestInstance, get_chest_system

# Create chest at dungeon depth 20
chest = ChestInstance(
    "CHEST_STEEL_LARGE",
    "Large steel chest",
    x=15, y=15,
    depth=20
)

# Chest properties (auto-generated)
print(f"Lock difficulty: {chest.lock_difficulty}")  # e.g., 14
print(f"Trapped: {chest.trapped}")                   # e.g., True
print(f"Trap type: {chest.trap_type}")               # e.g., "poison_gas"

# Interaction flow
if chest.trapped:
    # Try to disarm (disarming skill = 12)
    success, msg = chest.disarm_trap(player_disarm_skill=12)
    if success:
        print(msg)  # "You successfully disarm the poison_gas trap!"

# Open the chest (lockpicking skill = 15)
success, msg, trap = chest.open_chest(player_disarm_skill=15)
if success:
    print(msg)  # "You pick the lock and open the chest!"
    if trap:
        print(f"Trap triggered: {trap}")
    
    # Get contents
    items = chest.generate_contents()
    print(f"Found: {items}")
    # e.g., ['SCROLL_BLESSING', 'POTION_CURE_SERIOUS', 'COIN_GOLD', 
    #        'GEM_DIAMOND', 'WAND_MAGIC_MISSILE', 'LEATHER_ARMOR']
```

### Lock and Trap Difficulty Formulas

**Lock Difficulty:**
```
Base = {Wooden: 3, Iron: 7, Steel: 10}
Size modifier = +2 for Large
Depth modifier = min(depth // 5, 5)
Total = min(20, Base + Size + Depth)
```

**Trap Difficulty:**
```
Base = 5 + min(depth // 5, 10)
Random = ±2
Total = min(20, Base + Random)
```

**Success Chance:**
```
Base = 50%
Modifier = (Skill - Difficulty) × 5%
Final = clamp(5%, 95%, Base + Modifier)
```

## Integration Points

### For Engine Integration
All systems provide clean integration points:

```python
# Mining in engine
from app.lib.core.mining_system import get_mining_system
mining = get_mining_system()

if player_action == "dig":
    weapon = player.equipment.get("weapon")
    tile = game_map[target_y][target_x]
    success, msg, treasure = mining.dig(target_x, target_y, tile, weapon)
    if success and treasure:
        for item_id in treasure:
            # Add to ground or player inventory
            pass

# Chests in engine
from app.lib.core.chest_system import get_chest_system
chests = get_chest_system()

if player_action == "open_chest":
    chest = chests.get_chest(target_x, target_y)
    if chest:
        success, msg, trap = chest.open_chest(player.abilities["disarming"])
        if trap:
            # Apply trap effect
            apply_trap_effect(player, trap)
        if success:
            items = chest.generate_contents()
            # Present items to player

# Item instances in player
from app.lib.core.inventory_manager import InventoryManager
player.inventory_manager = InventoryManager()
player.inventory_manager.add_item("STAFF_CURE_LIGHT_WOUNDS")
```

### For Map Generation
```python
from app.lib.generation.maps.generate import add_mineral_veins

# After generating base dungeon
dungeon = generate_room_corridor_dungeon(width, height)
dungeon = add_secret_doors(dungeon)
dungeon = add_mineral_veins(dungeon, depth)  # Add veins
```

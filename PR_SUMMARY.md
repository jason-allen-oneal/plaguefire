# Summary of Changes

## Overview
This PR implements visual projectile effects, item physics simulation, and an ammo recovery system as requested in issue #[number].

## What's New

### 1. Visual Projectile System
- **Spells and magic** now display visual projectiles flying from caster to target
- **Thrown items** (arrows, daggers, potions) show flight path animations
- Projectiles use Bresenham's line algorithm for smooth, accurate paths
- Color-coded by type: magic (magenta), arrows (yellow), fire (red), ice (cyan), etc.
- Animated at ~20 FPS for smooth visual feedback

### 2. Item Physics & Rolling Animation
- **Dropped items** now "roll" across the floor before settling
- Physics simulation includes velocity, friction, and boundary checking
- Items bounce off walls and find nearest valid floor tile
- Applies to:
  - Manual item drops (d key)
  - Enemy death loot
  - Failed pickups

### 3. Ammo Recovery System
- Ammunition can now be recovered after use!
- **Recovery rates:**
  - Clean miss (no target): 90%
  - Miss target: 80%
  - Hit target: 50%
- Recovered ammo appears on the ground and can be picked up
- Applies to: Arrows, Bolts, Darts, Javelins

## Files Changed

### New Files
- `app/lib/core/projectile.py` - Core projectile and physics classes
- `tests/test_projectile_system.py` - Unit tests (8 tests)
- `tests/test_visual_effects_integration.py` - Integration tests (5 tests)
- `VISUAL_EFFECTS.md` - Comprehensive documentation

### Modified Files
- `app/lib/core/engine.py` - Added projectile/physics management
- `app/ui/dungeon_view.py` - Added projectile rendering and animation
- `tests/test_ground_items.py` - Updated for physics simulation
- `tests/test_high_priority_todos.py` - Updated drop test

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: 8 new tests for projectile system
- **Integration Tests**: 5 new tests for complete workflows
- **Updated Tests**: 2 existing tests adapted for physics
- **Total**: 97 tests, all passing ✓

### Test Categories
1. Projectile path calculation (Bresenham's algorithm)
2. Projectile advancement and lifecycle
3. Color coding by projectile type
4. Item physics simulation
5. Friction and settling behavior
6. Spell projectile creation
7. Thrown item projectiles
8. Ammo recovery mechanics
9. Drop physics integration
10. Entity death item physics

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns**: Projectile logic separate from game engine
- **Clean Integration**: Minimal changes to existing code
- **Performance**: Projectiles auto-cleanup, physics runs only when needed
- **Bounds Safety**: All positions validated against map boundaries

### Key Classes
- `Projectile`: Manages visual projectile animation
- `DroppedItem`: Simulates 2D physics for items
- Engine methods: `add_projectile()`, `update_dropped_items()`
- View methods: `_animate_projectiles()`, projectile rendering

### Performance
- O(1) projectile cleanup
- O(n) physics updates where n = active dropped items
- Maximum 20 physics steps per item (prevents infinite loops)
- Animation timer: 0.05s interval

## Backward Compatibility
- ✓ Existing save games work without modification
- ✓ All existing tests pass
- ✓ No data file changes required
- ✓ No breaking API changes

## Future Enhancements
Possible future additions (not in scope for this PR):
- Particle effects/trails
- Monster ranged attack projectiles
- Impact/splash effects
- Configurable animation speeds
- Sound effects on impact
- Bounce physics

## How to Test

### Manual Testing
1. **Spell Projectiles**: Create a mage, cast Magic Missile at an enemy
2. **Thrown Items**: Throw an arrow/dagger at an enemy or empty space
3. **Ammo Recovery**: Throw arrows, pick them back up after combat
4. **Item Physics**: Drop items and watch them roll
5. **Enemy Loot**: Kill an enemy, watch loot scatter

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
python tests/run_tests.py

# Run projectile tests only
python tests/test_projectile_system.py

# Run integration tests only
python tests/test_visual_effects_integration.py
```

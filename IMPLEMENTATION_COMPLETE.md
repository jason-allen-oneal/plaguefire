## Deferred Items (7/17)

These items require significant architectural changes beyond minimal modifications:

### Drop Item
- **Blocker**: Requires ground items system
- **Impact**: Need to implement tile-based item storage, pickup mechanics, and visual representation

### Aim/Zap Wand & Use/Zap Staff
- **Blocker**: Requires ItemInstance integration into Player class
- **Impact**: Major refactoring from string-based inventory to object-based system

### Fire/Throw Item
- **Blocker**: Requires projectile system
- **Impact**: Need trajectory calculation, range mechanics, and ammunition tracking

### Disarm Trap
- **Blocker**: Requires floor trap system
- **Impact**: Chest traps exist but floor traps need new implementation

### Fill Lamp
- **Blocker**: Requires fuel tracking system
- **Impact**: Need fuel consumption mechanics and depletion handling

### Exchange Weapon
- **Blocker**: Requires secondary weapon slot
- **Impact**: Player class currently has single weapon slot, needs architectural change

## Technical Notes

### Code Quality
- All implementations follow existing code patterns
- Safe null checking for player access
- Custom inscriptions integrated with existing inscription system
- Equipment displayed with inscribed names
- All screens use consistent Textual UI patterns

### Testing
- All existing tests pass (8/8)
- No new test failures introduced
- CodeQL security scan: 0 alerts
- No regressions detected

### Compatibility
- All changes backward compatible with save system
- New Player fields (custom_inscriptions) handled gracefully
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Ground Items System**: Implement tile-based item storage for Drop Item functionality
2. **ItemInstance Migration**: Gradual migration of Player inventory to use ItemInstance objects
3. **Projectile System**: Add trajectory, range, and ammunition mechanics for throwing/firing
4. **Floor Trap System**: Extend chest trap mechanics to floor tiles
5. **Fuel System**: Add fuel tracking for light sources with consumption over time
6. **Equipment Slots**: Expand equipment system to support multiple weapon slots

## Files Modified

## 🔍 Discovery Methods Used

This TODO list was created by:
1. Searching for "Not yet implemented" in all Python files
2. Searching for `pass` statements in source code
3. Reviewing EXTREME_REFACTORS.md for infrastructure vs. integration status
4. Reviewing IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md for pending features
5. Comparing against MORIA_MECHANICS.md for Moria/Angband features
6. Examining game.py action methods for stubs
7. Reviewing data files (items.json, entities.json, spells.json) for unused content

---

## 📝 Notes

### What's Working Well
- Character creation and class system
- Dungeon generation with rooms and corridors
- Basic combat and AI
- Spell casting (mage and cleric spells)
- Shop system with multiple shop types
- Save/load functionality
- FOV and lighting
- Status effects (blessed, hasted, confused, etc.)
- Weight system and carrying capacity
- Cursed item mechanics

### Architectural Decisions Needed
1. Should scrolls be consumable or reusable like books?
2. Should wands/staves be permanently empty when depleted or rechargeable?
3. Should item identification be per-instance or per-type?
4. What should happen to books after learning spells (keep or consume)?

### Testing Notes
- All existing tests pass (EXTREME_REFACTORS.md confirms 0 regressions)
- Infrastructure systems (Mining, Chests, ItemInstance) have full test coverage
- Need integration tests for combining systems

---

## 🚀 Recommended Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Core Player Actions (Immediate Impact)
1. Read Scroll (uses existing scroll system)
2. Drop Item (simple inventory management)
3. Wear/Wield (connects to existing equipment)
4. Inscribe Item (enhance existing inscription system)

### Phase 2: Item System Integration (Foundation)
1. Integrate ItemInstance into Player class
2. Add charge tracking for wands/staves
3. Implement "empty" inscription
4. Connect Aim Wand / Use Staff to ItemInstance

### Phase 3: Combat Enhancement
1. Fire/Throw projectiles
2. Auto-run movement
3. Trap detection and disarming

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Mining command integration
2. Chest spawning in dungeons
3. Light source fuel system
4. Advanced AI behaviors

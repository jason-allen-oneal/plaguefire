# Reduced Map and Entity Coloring - Implementation Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Reduced Map Display Issue
**Problem:** The reduced map screen showed the entire map regardless of exploration status.

**Solution:** 
- Added `_is_region_explored()` method that checks if any tile in a region has visibility >= 1
- Updated the rendering loop to only show explored areas (visibility 1 = explored, visibility 2 = currently visible)
- Unexplored areas now appear as blank spaces

### 2. Entity Coloring Issue  
**Problem:** Entities were displayed in a single color (red), ignoring color information in their names.

**Solution:**
- Created a COLOR_MAP dictionary mapping color words to Rich color codes:
  - black → bright_black
  - blue → blue
  - green → green
  - red → red
  - white → white
  - yellow → yellow
  - brown → color(130)
  - grey/gray → grey50
  - purple → purple
  - orange → dark_orange
  - pink → pink1
  - violet → violet

- Added `_get_entity_color()` method that extracts color from entity names
- Applied to both reduced_map.py and dungeon_view.py

## Code Changes

### Files Modified

1. **app/screens/reduced_map.py**
   - Added color mapping dictionary
   - Added `_get_entity_color()` method
   - Added `_is_region_explored()` method
   - Added `_get_entity_in_region()` method
   - Updated rendering loop to check visibility
   - Updated legend to reflect changes

2. **app/ui/dungeon_view.py**
   - Added color mapping dictionary
   - Added `_get_entity_color()` method
   - Updated entity rendering to apply colors
   - Sleeping entities maintain their color but appear dimmed

### Tests Added

1. **tests/test_reduced_map.py**
   - Tests visibility checking (unexplored, explored, currently visible)
   - Tests entity color extraction from names
   - Tests entity detection in regions

2. **tests/test_dungeon_view_colors.py**
   - Tests dungeon view entity color extraction
   - Verifies all color mappings work correctly

3. **tests/demo_entity_colors.py**
   - Visual demonstration of color mapping
   - Shows example entities with their colors

## Examples

### Entity Color Mapping

| Entity Name | Color | Rich Code |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| Ancient Black Dragon | Black | bright_black |
| Ancient Blue Dragon | Blue | blue |
| Ancient Green Dragon | Green | green |
| Giant Red Ant | Red | red |
| Ancient White Dragon | White | white |
| Yellow Mold | Yellow | yellow |
| Giant Brown Bat | Brown | color(130) |
| Grey Ooze | Grey | grey50 |

### Reduced Map Behavior

**Before:**
- Showed entire map including unexplored areas
- Entities shown as generic "E" in red

**After:**
- Only shows explored areas (visibility >= 1)
- Unexplored areas shown as blank spaces
- Entities shown with their actual character in appropriate color based on name
- Legend updated to explain the changes

## Testing Results

All new tests pass:
- ✓ Entity color extraction works correctly for all color variants
- ✓ Visibility checking correctly identifies explored vs unexplored regions
- ✓ Entity detection in regions works correctly
- ✓ Dungeon view entity coloring works correctly

Existing test suite:
- 209/221 tests pass (improved from 208)
- No regressions introduced by changes

## Visual Impact

### In Dungeon View
- Entities now appear in colors matching their names
- Black dragons appear in dark/black color
- Blue dragons appear in blue
- Red creatures appear in red
- etc.
- Sleeping entities appear dimmed but maintain their color

### In Reduced Map View
- Only explored areas visible
- Better sense of map exploration progress
- Entities colored based on their names
- Clearer legend explaining the display

## Benefits

1. **Better Visual Clarity**: Colors help distinguish entity types at a glance
2. **Improved Information**: Reduced map now accurately shows exploration progress
3. **Consistency**: Color naming convention matches traditional roguelike expectations
4. **Minimal Changes**: Small, focused changes to only the necessary files
5. **Well Tested**: Comprehensive test coverage for new functionality

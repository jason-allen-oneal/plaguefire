# Implementation Summary: Pending MORIA Mechanics

This document summarizes the pending functionalities that were implemented from `docs/MORIA_MECHANICS.md`.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

### 1. Movement Speed Penalty When Overweight
**Status:** Fully Implemented

**Implementation Details:**
- Added `get_speed_modifier()` method in Player class
- Progressive penalty calculation: 1.0x (normal) to 2.0x (50% slower) at 100% excess weight
- Formula: `penalty = 1.0 + min(excess_percent / 100, 1.0)`
- Periodic warning messages to player every 50 turns when burdened
- Test coverage in `tests/test_pending_mechanics.py`

**Files Changed:**
- `app/lib/generation/entities/player.py` - Added speed modifier calculation
- `app/lib/core/engine.py` - Added overweight warning system

### 2. Weight Limit Checking on Item Pickup
**Status:** Fully Implemented

**Implementation Details:**
- Engine now uses `can_pickup_item()` before adding items from enemy drops
- Players receive clear feedback when items can't be picked up
- Respects both weight limits (STR-based capacity) and 22-item inventory limit
- Messages like: "You find a Chain Mail, but that item would put you over your weight limit (4200/4000)."

**Files Changed:**
- `app/lib/core/engine.py` - Modified drop handling to check pickup eligibility

### 3. Word of Recall Delayed Teleport Mechanic
**Status:** Fully Implemented

**Implementation Details:**
- 20-turn countdown before teleport activates
- Progress messages every 5 turns ("Recall in 15 turns...")
- Teleports to town (depth 0) when used in dungeon
- Teleports to deepest visited level when used in town
- Player tracks `deepest_depth` for proper recall targeting
- Works for both scrolls and spells with teleport effect (range > 1000)

**Files Changed:**
- `app/lib/core/engine.py` - Added recall system (activation, countdown, execution)
- `app/lib/generation/entities/player.py` - Added `deepest_depth` tracking and serialization

**Key Methods:**
```python
# Engine class
def activate_recall(self)         # Start 20-turn countdown
def _execute_recall(self)         # Execute teleport after delay

# Player class
self.deepest_depth: int          # Tracks deepest dungeon level
```

### 4. Deepest Depth Tracking
**Status:** Fully Implemented

**Implementation Details:**
- Player now tracks `deepest_depth` attribute
- Automatically initialized from current depth on character creation
- Persisted in save files via `to_dict()` method
- Used by Word of Recall to determine dungeon recall target

**Files Changed:**
- `app/lib/generation/entities/player.py` - Added attribute and serialization

### 5. Comprehensive Test Coverage
**Status:** Complete

**Implementation Details:**
- Created `tests/test_pending_mechanics.py` with 3 test suites
- Tests speed penalty calculation and progression
- Tests weight limit enforcement on pickup
- Tests deepest depth tracking and serialization
- All tests passing

## ‚è∏Ô∏è Not Implemented (Requires Major Changes)

### "empty" Inscription for Wands/Staves
**Reason:** Requires item instance tracking system

Currently, items are tracked by name only. Implementing charge tracking requires:
- Item instance system (track individual items, not just names)
- Charge counter per instance
- Charge usage on wand/staff activation
- Identification system integration

**Estimated Scope:** Large architectural change, not suitable for minimal modifications

### "tried" Inscription for Unidentified Items
**Reason:** Requires item instance tracking system

Similar to "empty" inscription, this requires:
- Item instance system
- Per-instance identification state
- Usage tracking per instance

**Estimated Scope:** Large architectural change, not suitable for minimal modifications

### Mining System
**Reason:** Large feature requiring map generation changes

Full implementation would require:
- New tile types (quartz veins, magma veins, granite)
- Digging mechanics and tool bonuses
- Digging progress tracking
- Treasure spawning in veins
- Map generation updates
- UI/command integration

**Estimated Scope:** Major feature addition, not suitable for minimal modifications

### Chest Interaction System
**Reason:** Large feature requiring new interaction mechanics

Full implementation would require:
- Lock/trap system
- Disarming mechanics
- Force-open mechanics with damage chance
- Contents generation system
- Multiple new commands (open, disarm, force)
- UI integration

**Estimated Scope:** Major feature addition, not suitable for minimal modifications

## üìä Summary Statistics

- **Pending Items Reviewed:** 7 total
- **Implemented:** 4 (57%)
- **Not Implemented (Major Changes):** 4 (57%)
- **Files Modified:** 3
- **New Files Created:** 2 (test file + this summary)
- **Tests Added:** 3 test suites, all passing
- **Existing Tests:** All 8 existing tests still passing

## üîí Security Review

**CodeQL Analysis Results:**
- 1 alert flagged in `tests/test_pending_mechanics.py` line 169
- **Assessment:** False positive
- **Details:** Alert about logging `player_dict['deepest_depth']` - just an integer dungeon level in test output, not sensitive data
- **Action:** No fix needed

## üìù Documentation Updates

Updated `docs/MORIA_MECHANICS.md` to reflect:
- Movement speed penalty implementation and usage
- Weight limit checking on pickup
- Word of Recall delayed teleport mechanics
- Deepest depth tracking
- Code examples and status updates

## ‚ú® Quality Assurance

- ‚úÖ All existing tests passing
- ‚úÖ New tests created and passing
- ‚úÖ Code review completed and feedback addressed
- ‚úÖ Security scan completed
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated
- ‚úÖ Minimal changes principle followed
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes introduced

## üéØ Conclusion

All achievable pending functionalities from MORIA_MECHANICS.md have been successfully implemented with minimal, surgical changes to the codebase. The remaining items require significant architectural changes (item instance tracking system, mining mechanics, chest system) that are beyond the scope of minimal modifications and would constitute major feature additions rather than implementing pending functionality.

# Code Review Summary - Partial Implementations

**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Task**: Review code for partial implementations and compare with Moria/Angband

## Overview

A comprehensive review was conducted to identify all partial implementations, stubs, and missing features in the Plaguefire roguelike game. The findings are documented in `TODO.md`.

## Key Findings

### 1. Partial Implementations (17 items)
These are features that show "Not yet implemented" messages to players:
- Aim/Zap Wand
- Use/Zap Staff  
- Read Scroll
- Drop Item
- Fire/Throw Item
- Wear/Wield Item
- Pray
- Browse Book
- Disarm Trap
- Inscribe Item
- Change Name
- Fill Lamp
- Show Reduced Map
- View Scores
- Repeat Message
- Exchange Weapon
- Auto-Run

**Location**: `app/screens/game.py` lines 637-898

### 2. Infrastructure Ready but Not Integrated (3 systems)

#### Item Instance Tracking
- ✅ Core system exists (`app/lib/core/item_instance.py`)
- ✅ Tests pass (6 tests)
- ❌ Not integrated into Player class
- ❌ Charge tracking not active

#### Mining System
- ✅ Full system implemented (`app/lib/core/mining_system.py`)
- ✅ Tests pass (8 tests)
- ❌ No mining command in game
- ❌ Veins not added to dungeon generation

#### Chest System
- ✅ Complete implementation (`app/lib/core/chest_system.py`)
- ✅ Tests pass (9 tests)
- ❌ Chests not spawned in dungeons
- ❌ Interaction commands not wired up

### 3. Equipment Slot Gaps

Missing equipment slots in Player.equipment (currently only has "weapon" and "armor"):
- **Rings**: 30 ring items defined but no ring slots
- **Amulets**: 9 amulet items defined but no amulet slot
- **Shields**: Shield items exist but no shield slot

### 4. Pass Statements Found

Only 3 genuine stubs (not in tests):
1. `player.py:1098` - Charge tracking stub (comment present)
2. `engine.py:372` - Book consumption decision (comment present)
3. `item_instance.py:53` - Charge initialization (appropriate)

### 5. Comparison with Moria/Angband

**Present in Plaguefire**:
- ✅ Weight system and carrying capacity
- ✅ Cursed items
- ✅ Status effects
- ✅ Magic system (spells, scrolls)
- ✅ Town with shops
- ✅ Dungeon generation
- ✅ FOV system
- ✅ Save/load

**Missing from Moria/Angband**:
- ❌ Floor traps
- ❌ Ammunition system
- ❌ Item stacking
- ❌ Spell books as findable loot
- ❌ Monster pits and vaults
- ❌ Detailed character sheet
- ❌ Look command
- ❌ Stat gain on level up

## Statistics

- **Total TODO Items**: 70
- **High Priority**: 17 (core game actions)
- **Medium Priority**: 8 (system integrations)
- **Low Priority**: 45+ (enhancements)
- **Lines of Documentation**: 517 in TODO.md

## Recommended Next Steps

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 weeks)
1. Integrate ItemInstance into Player class
2. Add Read Scroll functionality
3. Add Drop Item functionality
4. Add equipment slots (rings, amulets, shields)

### Phase 2: Major Features (2-4 weeks)
1. Wire up Mining system
2. Wire up Chest system
3. Implement wand/staff charge usage
4. Add projectile/throwing system

### Phase 3: Polish (ongoing)
1. Add floor traps
2. Implement ammunition system
3. Add advanced AI behaviors
4. Create quest system

## Testing Status

✅ All existing tests pass (8/8)
- Spell learning tests
- Status effects tests
- Scroll/book tests
- Item instance tests
- Mining tests
- Chest tests

## Documentation

The following documents were reviewed:
- `EXTREME_REFACTORS.md` - Implementation details for 3 major systems
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Pending MORIA mechanics status
- `MORIA_MECHANICS.md` - Comparison with Moria/Angband features
- `README.md` - Feature list and architecture

## Conclusion

The codebase is well-structured with comprehensive test coverage. Three major systems (ItemInstance, Mining, Chests) are fully implemented but not integrated into gameplay. Most "missing" features are actually planned enhancements rather than bugs. The TODO list provides a clear roadmap for completing partial implementations and adding Moria/Angband parity features.

**Overall Assessment**: Healthy codebase with clear technical debt tracking and good architectural separation.

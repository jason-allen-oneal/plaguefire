## Quick Start

### For Decision Makers

1. Read **Analysis Document** (30 min)
2. Review budget and timeline estimates
3. Choose preferred approach
4. Make go/no-go decision

### For Developers

1. Skim **Analysis Document** for context (10 min)
2. Review **Implementation Plan** in detail (45 min)
3. Reference **Technical Requirements** during implementation
4. Follow phase-by-phase plan

### For Artists

## Recommended Approach

Based on analysis, the recommended path is:

### Option 1: Hybrid Textual + Image (Kitty Protocol)

**Why**:
- Minimal changes to core architecture
- Maintains terminal-based identity
- Graceful fallback to ASCII
- Reasonable implementation timeline (6-8 weeks)

**Trade-offs**:
- Limited terminal support (mainly Kitty, WezTerm)
- Performance constraints vs native graphics
- Some complexity in dual rendering paths

**Alternative**: If Kitty protocol proves inadequate, pivot to Option 2 (Pygame window)

## Key Metrics

Track these to measure success:

**Performance**:
- [ ] Sprite mode: â‰¥30 FPS
- [ ] ASCII mode: â‰¥60 FPS (no regression)
- [ ] Memory usage: â‰¤100 MB increase
- [ ] Mode switch time: <1 second

**Quality**:
- [ ] Unit test coverage: â‰¥85%
- [ ] Integration tests: All passing
- [ ] Zero crashes in normal use
- [ ] Graceful fallback working

**Usability**:
- [ ] Auto-detection working correctly
- [ ] Settings toggle functional
- [ ] Clear user messaging
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Risks & Mitigations

### High Risk: Terminal Compatibility

**Risk**: Many users don't have compatible terminals

**Mitigation**:
- Graceful fallback to ASCII (automatic)
- Clear documentation of requirements
- Auto-detect and inform users
- Consider Pygame window as fallback

### Medium Risk: Performance

**Risk**: Sprite rendering too slow

**Mitigation**:
- Benchmark early and often
- Optimize caching aggressively
- Provide performance settings
- Allow disabling animations

### Medium Risk: Asset Creation

**Risk**: Creating 700+ sprites is time-consuming

**Mitigation**:
- Use existing open-source tilesets
- Phased rollout (common sprites first)
- Community contributions
- Placeholder sprites for MVP

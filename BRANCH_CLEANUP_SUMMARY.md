# Branch Cleanup Summary

## Problem
The repository had an extra branch: `copilot/update-ci-workflow-pyinstaller`

## Solution Implemented

Since the automated environment does not have direct permissions to delete remote branches, I've created tools to make it easy for you to delete the branch yourself.

### âœ… What Was Done

1. **Identified the extra branch**
   - Branch name: `copilot/update-ci-workflow-pyinstaller`
   - Status: 20 commits ahead of main, 1 commit behind
   - Assessment: Stale feature branch from previous PR work

2. **Created automated cleanup workflow**
   - File: `.github/workflows/cleanup-stale-branches.yml`
   - A GitHub Actions workflow that can delete branches with one click
   - Can be reused for future branch cleanups

3. **Created comprehensive documentation**
   - File: `DELETE_BRANCH.md`
   - Detailed analysis of the branch
   - Four different methods to delete it
   - Verification steps

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Action Required

**Choose one method to delete the branch:**

### Recommended: Use the GitHub Actions Workflow
1. Go to the Actions tab in your repository
2. Select "Cleanup Stale Branches" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Confirm and run

**Or** manually delete from: https://github.com/jason-allen-oneal/plaguefire/branches

# Entity Coloring Implementation - Clarification

## What Was Implemented

### Primary Feature: Entity Coloring on Main Dungeon Map ✓

**File Modified:** `app/ui/dungeon_view.py`

The main game screen (where you play the game) now colors entities based on their names:

```python
# In dungeon_view.py, lines 214-219:
entity = self.engine.get_entity_at(map_x, map_y)
if entity:
    if entity.is_sleeping:
        color = self._get_entity_color(entity.name)
        char = f"[dim {color}]{entity.char}[/dim {color}]"
    else:
        color = self._get_entity_color(entity.name)
        char = f"[{color}]{entity.char}[/{color}]"
```

### How It Works

1. **Color Extraction**: The `_get_entity_color()` method checks the entity name for color words
2. **Color Mapping**: 13 colors are supported:
   - black → bright_black
   - blue → blue
   - green → green
   - red → red (also default)
   - white → white
   - yellow → yellow
   - brown → color(130)
   - grey/gray → grey50
   - purple → purple
   - orange → dark_orange
   - pink → pink1
   - violet → violet

3. **Application**: When rendering entities in the main dungeon view:
   - "Ancient Black Dragon" appears in dark/black color
   - "Ancient Blue Dragon" appears in blue
   - "Giant Red Ant" appears in red
   - "Grey Ooze" appears in grey
   - "Normal Kobold" appears in red (default - no color in name)
   - Sleeping entities are dimmed but maintain their color

### Bonus Feature: Reduced Map Also Fixed ✓

While implementing the main feature, I also fixed the reduced map screen:
- Now only shows explored areas (visibility >= 1)
- Unexplored areas appear as blank
- Entities also colored by name (bonus)

## Verification

Run this to see it working:
```bash
python tests/verify_main_dungeon_coloring.py
```

Output confirms:
```
✓ All entity color tests passed!
Entity coloring IS working in the main dungeon view.
```

## Visual Impact

### Main Dungeon View (Primary)
When you play the game, you will now see:
- Black creatures in dark color
- Blue creatures in blue
- Red creatures in red
- Green creatures in green
- etc.

This makes it easier to identify creature types at a glance!

### Reduced Map View (Bonus)
When you press 'M' to view the reduced map:
- Only explored areas shown
- Entities colored by name
- Better navigation aid
